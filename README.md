Something I used to wonder as a kid, but chatgpt helped me almost prove it.


# Cool Digit Sum Conjecture

**Created by Shivang Dwivedi**  
Inspired by base-aware digit sums and digital root consistency

## About

The **Cool Digit Sum Conjecture** explores a fascinating pattern:

> For two numbers in a given base, the digital root of their sum often matches the digital root of the sum of their individual digits.

This tool allows you to test this with:
- Multiple bases: 2 (Binary), 8 (Octal), 10 (Decimal), and 16 (Hexadecimal)
- Instant feedback on whether the digital roots match
- A clean, mobile-friendly dark UI inspired by **Solo Leveling**

## Features

- Supports input in different bases
- Shows intermediate steps: digit sums, conversions, digital roots
- Preloaded with multiple base-10 examples for better understanding
- Open source, easy to extend
-

## Fun Fact

This project — from recalling the idea this time around to full deployment — was created in **less than 2 hours**  
as a spontaneous and fun mathematical experiment by **Shivang Dwivedi**.
